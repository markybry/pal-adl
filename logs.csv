Staff & JR went out today, in the shift planner he needed £50. Before I reminded him he told me which was fine. It was pouring with rain but we had a umbrella so all was good, we went to the barbers paid for the services & once we had left I reminded JR again we have to go to the cash machine to withdraw £50 he said it’s raining & wanted to go home so I said that he needs the money to put in his tin & that it will only add 7/8 minutes on our journey so we may as well go. JR said he will borrow money from the house tin, I did tell him that there’s not enough in there. I’m not sure where he’s got the idea of borrowing money from the house tin but this is the second time he’s said this & I’ve explained that the house tin is for emergencies only & in this case it is not a emergency. 
JR said to me if staff keep forcing him he starts to shout and sometimes hits staff so it’s best staff don’t force him. So then I just said to JR if you want to go home let’s go home.. Consequence: JR was absolutely fine when he got home went to his room with the snacks he brought from the shops, he's been listening to his music & staff has checked in on him & appears to be fine. Submitted an incident report, informed management,",false,15/01/2026 14:33:27,Raj Roath,,,,,,behaviour,incident

I asked if we could talk about what that means. I said as its the first visit and they haven't been together long, I'd advise not to have sex straight away, to get to know each other more and just cuddle. He did say they've kissed today. He agreed that he'll tell her that (not to have sex yet). He kept talking about it so I asked if he understood about protection. He didn't know about it so I explained he needs to protect against pregnancy and STDs. He kept saying he won't get her pregnant, reasons being he's had a hernia operation so so won't be able to and that his mother didn't use protection. I explained that the hernia doesn't have anything to do with fertility and that his mother got pregnant when she didn't use protection.

They used the following: . I had a conversation with Samuel today about his day centres. He didn't go to Karibu today. I wanted to understand why and how he feels about Karibu. He seemed reluctant to say anything, I assured him we all want him to be happy and do the things he enjoys. He said he doesn't feel like Karibu is for him. I asked if he prefers Speaking Space, if he had the option to go either to Speaking Space or Karibu, which would be choose. He said he'd go to Speaking Space if he had to choose. I then asked if there was an option for him to go on Tuesdays to Speaking Space, would he prefer that. He said yes, he'd prefer that. I asked if he's sure as he often struggles to go on Mondays too, would he go twice per week. He somewhat reluctantly said he would. Both me and staff on shift LC assured him he can say no, he doesn't have to commit to anything for now. I then asked how he feels about college, he smiled and said he likes college. I asked what about college he likes - he didn't know. I then asked if he had the option (and I emphasised it might not be an option) to go to college more than one day a week, would he like that. He noticeably cheered up and said yes enthusiastically. I asked again if he would like to attend college more - if it was an option. He again said yes very clearly. I thanked Samuel for being open and for chatting and that I will find out if either of those options are doable. Until then I did remind him he has Karibu as an option on Tuesdays.",false,03/02/2026 15:56:10,Sini Bryant,,,,,,,

Sat down with Jamie and discussed what being engaged means, Jamie understands with help from care staff and descriptions on Google that to get engaged means two people make a promise to eventually get marry. We also discussed why Jamie's dad and brother were upset that he went ahead and got engaged to his girlfriend without informing or discussing this decision with his family first. We discussed that family are a point of support and being engaged is a big decision that family usually are involved in regardless of who they are and where they live. Reinforced what being engaged means and Jamie was able to explain this back to me several times knowing that engaged means making a promise to marry in the future which includes a wedding and this can be expensive. We discussed that marriage is a legal act and comes with a lot of responsibility to each partner in the marriage contract. Jamie is happy and confident he understands this now, Jamie is also aware he can come to staff should he need more explainations or concerns regarding being engaged.
